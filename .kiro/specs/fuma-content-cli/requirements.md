# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The fuma-content CLI tool needs a robust command-line interface using Commander.js to handle bundling HTTP collections from various sources (Bruno, Panda) for use in Fuma Studio. The CLI should provide clear commands for different operations, proper help documentation, and error handling to ensure a smooth developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a CLI tool with clear commands, so that I can easily bundle my HTTP collections from different sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content --help` THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive help menu with all available commands
2. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content --version` THEN the system SHALL display the current version of the tool
3. WHEN the user runs an invalid command THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest valid alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bundle Bruno HTTP collections, so that I can use them in Fuma Studio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content bundle bruno <source-path>` THEN the system SHALL process Bruno collection files from the specified path
2. WHEN the user provides an output option `--output <path>` THEN the system SHALL save the bundled collection to the specified location
3. IF the source path does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the path is invalid
4. WHEN the bundling is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the output location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bundle Panda HTTP collections, so that I can use them in Fuma Studio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content bundle panda <source-path>` THEN the system SHALL process Panda collection files from the specified path
2. WHEN the user provides an output option `--output <path>` THEN the system SHALL save the bundled collection to the specified location
3. IF the source path does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the path is invalid
4. WHEN the bundling is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the output location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate my HTTP collections before bundling, so that I can catch errors early in the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content validate <source-path>` THEN the system SHALL check the collection files for syntax and structure errors
2. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL display a success message indicating the collection is valid
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages with file locations and specific issues
4. WHEN the user provides a `--type <bruno|panda>` option THEN the system SHALL validate using the specified collection type rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed information about my collections, so that I can understand what will be bundled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `fuma-content info <source-path>` THEN the system SHALL display collection metadata including number of requests, endpoints, and file structure
2. WHEN the user provides a `--type <bruno|panda>` option THEN the system SHALL analyze using the specified collection type
3. WHEN the source contains multiple collections THEN the system SHALL display information for each collection separately
4. WHEN the user provides `--verbose` flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including individual request details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with actionable guidance
2. WHEN the user provides `--verbose` flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed logging information during command execution
3. WHEN a command fails due to file system issues THEN the system SHALL display specific file system error details
4. WHEN a command is interrupted THEN the system SHALL clean up any temporary files and exit gracefully
